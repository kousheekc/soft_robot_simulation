# Soft Robot Simulation

## About The Project
Soft robot simulation application created using PySide6 and Matplotlib3D. The soft robot consists of 2 independent links with 3 cable-driven actuators each. A forward kinematics model is built based on the Piecewise Constant Curvature (PCC) method using Denavit Hartenberg formalism.
